        <h1>July Revolution (Bangladesh)</h1>
        <p>The July Revolution, also called the Student–People's Uprising, was a big protest for democracy in Bangladesh in 2024. It began in June when students, led by a group called Students Against Discrimination, protested against unfair job quotas in government jobs.</p>
        <p>This happened after the Supreme Court of Bangladesh canceled the old rules from 2018. At first, the protests were peaceful, but in late July, the government used force against the protesters, killing many of them. This tragic event is known as the July Massacre.

By August, the protests grew into a huge movement where people stopped cooperating with the government. This forced the Prime Minister at the time, Sheikh Hasina, to flee the country and escape to India. When she left, it caused a big problem with the country’s leadership. Eventually, an interim (temporary) government was set up, led by Muhammad Yunus, an economist from Bangladesh who won a Nobel Peace Prize. He became the main adviser to help run things.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>After the Awami League won the 2008 elections, they removed the caretaker government system.[6] They then won three more elections in a row (2014, 2018, and 2024). However, these elections were widely accused of being rigged. Most political parties in Bangladesh boycotted the 2014 and 2024 elections, though not the 2018 one. During this period, the government reportedly arrested and tortured opponents, pushing opposition leaders out of politics by convicting them in different cases.[7] The government also tightly controlled media and free speech, using laws like the Digital Security Act.[8][9]

Since 2009, Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has struggled to create jobs as promised. Although public sector jobs grew with better salaries, these positions were often given based on political connections.[10]

Reports say the government used police and Awami League supporters—including its student wing, the Chhatra League—to violently suppress protests, even non-political ones.[11] The Chhatra League has been accused of violent crackdowns at universities and other institutions.[12] Over these years, Awami League leaders faced accusations of corruption, money laundering, banking fraud, and mishandling financial reserves.[13][14] These problems contributed to higher living costs and public anger</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Quota reform movement
Further information: 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement
In 2018, students in Bangladesh started a big protest called the "2018 Bangladesh quota reform movement." It was led by the General Students' Rights Protection Council. They wanted changes to the quota system for government jobs. Because of their protests, the government decided to end the 46-year-old quota system.

But in 2021, seven children of freedom fighters, including Ahidul Islam, went to the High Court to challenge this decision. On June 5, 2024, the High Court, with Justices KM Kamrul Quader and Khizir Hayat, said the decision to remove the quota system wasn’t valid. Right after this ruling, students began protesting at different universities.

The protests grew stronger in July. Students blocked roads, including something called the "Bangla Blockade." The police used a lot of force to stop them, which led to fights. In Rangpur, a student named Abu Sayed was shot and killed by police. This made the movement even bigger and caused more tension across Bangladesh.[16]

After that, the protests turned violent in many places, including Dhaka. Law enforcement, along with groups like Chhatra League and Jubo League, attacked protesters, causing many deaths and injuries.[17] The government then put a curfew in place and shut down the internet. Because of all the unrest, the Appellate Division moved up its hearing date.[18]

On July 16, students from private universities joined the protests, making the movement even stronger. The government then closed all schools and universities on July 16, 2024. The next day, July 17, students living in public university dorms, like at Dhaka University, had to leave. But many private university students stayed in Dhaka because they live there permanently, and their numbers grew in the city by July 18.[19]

On July 18, there was a big clash in Rampura between police and students from Primeasia University, BRAC University, and East West University. At the same time, students from AIUB, North South University, Independent University, Dhaka International University, and UIU protested along Kuril Bishwa Road and Pragati Sarani. Protests also happened in Mohakhali with students from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh University of Textiles, and Southeast University, as well as in Uttara with Northern University students.</p>
